## Backend Recommendations Summary

### High Priority (Phase 2)
1. **Dashboard Stats Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /api/Dashboard/stats
   ```
   *Reason:* Dashboard shows 0 for all counts currently

2. **Paginated Search**
   ```
   GET /api/Search?limit=20&offset=0
   ```
   *Reason:* Performance with large datasets

3. **Aggregated Person Data**
   ```
   GET /api/Person/{id}/full
   ```
   *Reason:* Reduce multiple API calls

### Medium Priority (Phase 3)
4. **Tree Data Structure**
   ```
   GET /api/Person/{id}/tree?generations=3
   ```
   *Reason:* Required for family tree visualization

5. **Timeline Data**
   ```
   GET /api/Person/{id}/timeline
   ```
   *Reason:* Optimized for timeline rendering

### Nice to Have
6. **Relationship Suggestions** (ML-based)
7. **Geocoding Integration**
8. **WebSocket for Real-time Updates**
9. **Full-text Search** (Elasticsearch/similar)

## Questions for Backend Team

1. **Stats Endpoint:** Can we add a dashboard stats endpoint?
2. **Pagination:** What's the max result size before we need pagination?
3. **Real-time:** Any plans for WebSocket support?
4. **Search:** Is full-text search available or planned?
5. **Rate Limiting:** What are the current API rate limits?
6. **Geocoding:** Should we integrate external service or add backend support?

---

## Open Issues

- [ ] Authentication integration (Firebase configured but not used)
- [ ] Error handling strategy (toast notifications vs inline)
- [ ] Offline mode support
- [ ] Mobile app consideration (Capacitor/Ionic)
- [ ] Multi-language support (i18n)
