## 🚀 Ready for Development

### Immediate Next Steps (Developer Guide)

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:ui
   ```

3. **Pick a feature to implement:**
   - Enhanced Person Detail View (tabs, inline editing)
   - Places List (hierarchy, map integration)
   - Events Timeline (visual timeline)
   - Relationship Builder (visual graph)

4. **Follow the pattern:**
   - Look at `PeopleListComponent` as reference
   - Create service integration
   - Add E2E tests
   - Update documentation

---

## 🔌 Backend Integration Status

### Currently Working ✅
- SearchService (person search)
- PersonService (get person data)
- Authentication setup (Firebase configured)

### Ready to Use (Not Yet Integrated) 🚧
- PlaceService
- EventService
- ThingService
- RelationshipService
- ShareService
- DocumentService

### Recommended Backend Additions ⚠️

1. **Dashboard Stats**
   ```
   GET /api/Dashboard/stats
   → { people: 0, places: 0, events: 0, things: 0 }
   ```

2. **Paginated Search**
   ```
   GET /api/Search?query=...&limit=20&offset=0
   → { results: [...], total: 100 }
   ```

3. **Aggregated Person Data**
   ```
   GET /api/Person/{id}/full
   → Include relationships and events
   ```

See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for full list.
